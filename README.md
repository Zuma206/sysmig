# ⏩ sysmig

Declarative system configuration for linux

> [!NOTE]
> Full documentation is coming soon.

## Installation

### Install script

The recommended way to install sysmig is via a one-line bash script.

#### Using curl

```sh
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/sysmig https://github.com/Zuma206/sysmig/releases/download/v1.1.0/sysmig && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysmig
```

### Package Managers

sysmig is not and will never be officially packaged for any package manager. This is by design, as sysmig is expected to install and/or configure your package managers in a migration, and therefore should be installed outside of them.

## Updating

```sh
sudo sysmig update
```
